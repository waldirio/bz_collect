# bz_collect

This project will help you to collect BugZilla information via API.

You can download the binary version in the Releases area (right side). In this case, no virtual environment or additional steps will be necessary.

About the use, please, proceed as below

 - Download the BZ API key from [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/userprefs.cgi?tab=apikey)
 - Download the latest version of the binary [here](https://github.com/waldirio/bz_collect/releases/latest)
 - Create a file in your home directory, called `~/.bz_api_key` and add ONLY your `API Key` to this file.

 At this moment, you will be good to go and run the app.

 ```
 $ ./bz_collect
 ```
 and it will result in an output as below
 ```

saving the file
Done, file 'Gofer.csv' created.
press any key to continue
```
Note. If you would like to export data about a different product, just type `2` once again, type the code and press enter.

Great, at this moment, a file with the product name will be created. Here we can see `Gofer.csv` and checking the content of this file, we can see some fields. Below it's an example.
```
$ cat Gofer.csv 
load_data,bz_id,product,component,status,resolution,summary,version,keywords,creator,severity,create_time,close_time,customer_case_attached

```
After that, you can import this data in your best SpreadSheet and play with it.




If you would like to play with the code and/or contribute, I really recommend you to prepare a virtual environment, install all the python modules according to the `requirement.txt` file and then voil√°, you will be able to run it.

Note, there is a script called `start_here.sh` where this will load the virtual environment and will run the script. Attention, some changes on the file will be required.


I really hope you enjoy it.
