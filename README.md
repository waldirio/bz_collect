# bz_collect

The main idea of this project is to help you to collect BugZilla information via API.

The code was made on python 3.6.z and I really recommend you to prepare a virtual environment, install all the python modules according to `requirement.txt` and then voil√°, you will be able to run the code.

Note, there is a script called `start_here.sh` where this will load the virtual environment and will run the script. Attention, some changes on the file will be required.

Hope you enjoy it.
